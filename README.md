Execute custom Shell commands whenever you need using a combobox on the Netbeans Toolbar.

The latest command can be executed by pressing Cmd+Shift+E (No other action can use this same shortcut in order for this to work)

Some simple commands ideas you might want to use:
<ol>
    <li>Open urls on the browser</li>
    <li>upload a file to an FTP Server</li>
    <li>Run your personal shell script file</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ol>
